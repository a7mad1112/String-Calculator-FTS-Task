# String-Calculator-FTS-Task

This is a simple String Calculator that can add up to 2 numbers. 
It can also handle an unknown amount of numbers and will ignore any numbers greater than 1000.
If the input includes negative numbers,
the calculator will throw an exception "negatives not allowed" and display all negative numbers that were passed.
